  <p class="bible">1 Thessalonians 5:18-24 KJV  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
   (19)  Quench not the Spirit.  (20)  Despise not prophesyings.  (21)  Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
   (22)  Abstain from all appearance of evil.  (23)  And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
  whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  (24)  Faithful is he
  that calleth you, who also will do it.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">2 Peter 1:19-21 KJV  We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light
  that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  (20)  Knowing this first, that
  no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.  (21)  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will
  of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.


</p>

  <p class="bible" >2 Peter 2:1 KJV  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,
  who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift
  destruction.

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 4:8 KJV  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 4:11-16 KJV  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and
teachers;  (12)  For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
 (13)  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:  (14)  That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive;  (15)  But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:
 (16)  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to
the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 19:13-20 KJV  Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits
the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  (14)  And there were seven sons of one
Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.  (15)  And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and
Paul I know; but who are ye?  (16)  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and
prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  (17)  And this was known to all the Jews
and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  (18)  And
many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.  (19)  Many of them also which used curious arts brought
their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand
pieces of silver.  (20)  So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

<h5>Who is an apostle?
</h5>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 3:1 KJV  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of
our profession, Christ Jesus;

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 10:38 KJV  How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and
healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Luke 24:18-19 KJV  And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in
Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?  (19)  And he said unto them, What
things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and
all the people:

</p>

<p class="bible">Luke 24:25-27 KJV  Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
 (26)  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  (27)  And beginning at Moses and
all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 4:12-19 KJV  Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;  (13)  And
leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
 (14)  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  (15)  The land of Zabulon, and the
land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;  (16)  The people which sat in
darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.  (17)  From that
time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  (18)  And Jesus, walking by the
sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were
fishers.  (19)  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 10:13-15 KJV  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  (14)  How then shall they call
on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they
hear without a preacher?  (15)  And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the
feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Peter 1:9-12 KJV  Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.  (10)  Of which salvation the
prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:  (11)  Searching
what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.  (12)  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but
unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you
with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

</p>

<p class="text">Ministry is the outgrowth of holy living
</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 12:1-7 KJV  Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  (2)  Ye know that ye
were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.  (3)  Wherefore I give you to understand, that
no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the
Holy Ghost.  (4)  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.  (5)  And there are differences of
administrations, but the same Lord.  (6)  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh
all in all.  (7)  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 12:11 KJV  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he
will.
